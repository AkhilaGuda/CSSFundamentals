                Ratan Naval Tata is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and former chairman of Tata Sons. Born on
                December 28, 1937, he led the Tata Group to global prominence through innovation, ethical leadership,
                and bold acquisitions such as Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley. Under his leadership, Tata became a symbol
                of Indian excellence in business. A strong believer in giving back to society, he has also contributed
                extensively to education, healthcare, and rural development. Ratan Tata is widely admired for his
                humility, vision, and values-driven approach to leadership.
